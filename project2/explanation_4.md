#User group

I found this also very straight forward, to solve it I recursively traversed the lists of lists and compared the userIds for each user 
until I found or didn't find the user I was searching for, if I found the user, then the result true is returned, else I return false.

###Time complexity
- The time complexity for the search is O(n)
###Space complexity
- The space complexity for this operation is O(m)
where m is the number of frames generated by the recursive calls.
